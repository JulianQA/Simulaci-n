# Simulation
It is a library which consists of a simulation of quantum probability calculations. Which consists of the probability of the marbles being on one side or the other after a certain time (click), also the probability in a multiple slit calculation, the experiments of multiple probabilistic classic slits, with more than two slits and multiple multiple slits

# How does it work?
It is a Python library, to use it you have to download the .py file called 'Canicas.py' on your PC, it is based on functions which resolve the points mentioned above. Some need parameters, others just need to change the value of the variables you need. returns matrices, vectors or values as the case may be.
# Examples
```python
